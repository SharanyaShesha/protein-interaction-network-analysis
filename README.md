# Human Protein-Protein Interaction Network Analysis

This project analyzes a large-scale human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network using data from the BioGRID database. It focuses on identifying network hubs, assessing the degree distribution for scale-free properties, computing shortest path lengths, and analyzing centrality metrics (betweenness and closeness) to identify key proteins in the network.

## üìà Results

### 1. Top 10 Hub Nodes (by Degree)
These proteins have the highest number of interactions:
ZRANB1 ‚Äì 4160
PARK2 ‚Äì 3426
EGFR ‚Äì 3070
PLEKHA4 ‚Äì 2971
KIAA1429 ‚Äì 2932
KRAS ‚Äì 2891
MYC ‚Äì 2817
CCNF ‚Äì 2798
CUL3 ‚Äì 2656
TRIM25 ‚Äì 2497

### 2. Degree Distribution Plot

#### Interpretation:
- The log-log degree distribution suggests **power-law behavior**, a key indicator of a **scale-free network**.
- **Logarithmic Y-axis** reveals a linear trend: few nodes have very high connectivity (hubs), while most have few connections.
- This implies **biological robustness**, where the network is resistant to random node failures but sensitive to targeted hub disruption.

### 3. Shortest Path Length Distribution

#### Key Observations:
- **Most paths have a length of 3**, indicating high connectivity and efficient information flow.
- **Significant presence at lengths 2 and 4** suggests moderate clustering.
- Very **few paths are at lengths 1 or 5**, and none exceed 5 ‚Äî showing a compact, well-connected network.

### 4. Top 10 Nodes by Betweenness Centrality
Nodes acting as critical bridges in the network: CCNF, UBC, NR3C1, TRIM25, EGFR, ZRANB1, KIAA1429, APP, PARK2, OTUD4. 

### 5. Top 10 Nodes by Closeness Centrality
Nodes that are most central in terms of average shortest path: 57664, 25962, 7157, 43740578, 7706, 4609, 1994, 7316, 351, 3191.

## Interpretation
The analysis confirms that the human PPI network exhibits:
- **Scale-free structure**
- **Biological modularity**
- **Small-world properties**
- Central hubs that may serve as **potential therapeutic targets** in systems biology or disease modeling
